## Running application locally

1. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

2. Install all dependences of a server side

    ```bash
        $ cd my-cloud-client/
        $ npm install
    ```
3. Install all dependences of a client side

    ```bash
        $ bower install
    ```
4. Install nodemon tool that will keep the node server from having to be restarted each time the code is changed:

    ```bash
        $ npm install -g nodemon
    ```
5. Run a development version of the application

    ```bash
        $ npm start
    ```

6. Check it works on port 3000. Follow the address (Make sure that port 3000 is not bound)

    [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
